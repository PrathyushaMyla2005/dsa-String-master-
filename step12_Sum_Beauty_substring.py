'''roblem Statement

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters,
your task is to find the sum of the beauty values of all possible substrings of s.

üí° Definition

The beauty of a substring is defined as:

Beauty = (frequency of most frequent character) ‚àí (frequency of least frequent character)

‚ö†Ô∏è While calculating the least frequent character,
ignore characters that do not appear in the substring (i.e., frequency = 0).

üß† What is a Substring?

A substring is a continuous sequence of characters within a string.

Example:
If s = "abc", the substrings are:

"a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc"

üßÆ Example

Input:

s = "aabcb"
Output: 5
Explanation:
The substrings of "aabcb" are:
"a", "a", "b", "c", "b", "aa", "ab", "bc", "cb", "aab", "abc", "bcb", "aabcb"
The beauty values of these substrings are:
"a" -> 0
"a" -> 0
"b" -> 0
"c" -> 0
"b" -> 0
"aa" -> 0
"ab" -> 1 (most frequent: 'a' or 'b' = 1, least frequent: 'a' or 'b' = 1)
"bc" -> 1 (most frequent: 'b' or 'c' = 1, least frequent: 'b' or 'c' = 1)
"cb" -> 1 (most frequent: 'c' or 'b' = 1, least frequent: 'c' or 'b' = 1)
"aab" -> 1 (most frequent: 'a' = 2, least frequent: 'b' = 1)
"abc" -> 1 (most frequent: 'a', 'b', or 'c' = 1, least frequent: 'a', 'b', or 'c' = 1)
"bcb" -> 1 (most frequent: 'b' = 2, least frequent: 'c' = 1)
"aabcb" -> 2 (most frequent: 'a' or 'b' = 2, least frequent: 'c' = 1)
